# What's a split-flap display?
A [split-flap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-flap_display) is an electro-mechanical display technology, previously common in airports and train stations, and named for the letter flaps that are split in half.

Split-flap displays have a few advantages compared to modern LED/LCD displays, like:
- ðŸ”‹ no power required when contents are static
- ðŸ’¡ no glow like a light-based display
- ðŸ”Š makes sound when new information is available (like when your flight is canceled!)
- ðŸ˜Ž sounds and looks sweet

But they have one BIG disadvantage: **maintenance/complexity** ðŸ™€

# How do I build one?
Check out the [github repo](https://github.com/scottbez1/splitflap) to find source designs as well as links to instructions and ordering info.

I also sell some of the custom parts in my [Etsy store](https://bezeklabs.etsy.com) for your convenience (and to help fund continued development), but it's all open source so you're always welcome to build everything yourself!

The [splitflap community Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/wgehm3PcrC) is the best place to keep up with the latest changes or ask questions about the project!

# Why????
I love old mechanical technology, and I'm always a little sad when beautiful mechanical solutions are replaced by (far more practical) big, bright, colorful LEDs, so I sought to recreate split-flaps with more modern hobbyist-friendly tools.

It's become a passion project of mine over the last 9 years, and I LOVE seeing the displays and art installations others have built based on this open-source design!

# Acknowledgements
 - A huge thank you to:
   - Ben Flatau for being the mastermind behind the giant display and for all his time and help with Open Sauce 2023 and 2024
   - the City of Palo Alto whose art grant for [Code:ART 2021](https://www.cityofpaloalto.org/Departments/Community-Services/Arts-Sciences/Public-Art-Program/CodeART/CodeART-2021) originally made it possible to build something this big
   - and the whole team of volunteers that helped assemble/paint/install the 4320 flaps, electronics, and structure
 - Much of the original design inspiration came from some blog posts by The Beach Lab, which sadly don't seem to be online anymore and I haven't been able to find archives, but IIRC this is where the CR80 card idea and laser-cut drum structure came from
 - [Dave Madison built and documented](https://www.partsnotincluded.com/building-diy-split-flap-displays/) some great improvements on this design, and has contributed a ton of those changes back to the project, including the font generation script for custom vinyl cut or printed flaps!
 - And thank you to [everyone else who has contributed to the project over the years!](https://github.com/scottbez1/splitflap/graphs/contributors)

 - [Engineezy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_UEkRFP7fs) designed a 3d-printed version as a scoreboard
 - And lots of other DIY / Open Source designs!
