                <h1>Welcome</h1>
                <p>
                    This is a work in progress
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-flap_display" target="_blank">split-flap display</a>.
                    Each module can flip between 40 unique characters: letters, numbers, and a few symbols. Multiple
                    modules fit perfectly alongside each other to build bigger displays.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The primary design goal was to make something that's possible to fabricate at home in small or
                    single quantities and can be customized and built by an intermediate hobbyist at a reasonable price.
                    This meant using widely available materials and avoiding any tooling with a high upfront cost.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Following that philosophy, the design uses store-bought vinyl stickers for the letters, is driven
                    by an ubiquitous and cheap 28BYJ-48 stepper motor, and uses common PVC ID badge cards cut to shape
                    for the flaps (though custom die-cut flaps are also
                    <a href="https://www.tindie.com/products/14844/">available</a>).
                    Even the enclosure, spool, and gears, which are all made from laser-cut MDF, can be easily ordered online.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This design is currently nearly stable. The source code in the
                    <a href="https://github.com/scottbez1/splitflap" target="_blank">git repo</a>
                    has been used to produce several working prototypes, and the v0.5 design is stable enough to
                    have fairly comprehensive
                    <a href="https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Ordering-Splitflap-v0.5--ATdB3cgS5GyvwTWq1kpunkD4Ag-iCwwMo0hRkkAlwdutccWf">Ordering Instructions</a>
                    and an
                    <a href="https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Splitflap-Kit-v0.5-Assembly-Instructions--ATc8SYKflDsThTsXGZiRPOyTAg-bxXJlke5ROmamcx4OH44r">Assembly Guide</a>.
                    Of course, as this is an open source side-project, you may still come across minor issues or
                    missing documentation.

                    All of the designs are <a href="https://github.com/scottbez1/splitflap/">open source</a>. The 3d
                    model is built using OpenSCAD, the driver electronics board is designed in KiCad, and the driver
                    firmware is written using Arduino.

                    automatically</a> as the design changes, using Github Actions. This way you can always see the latest
                    designs, even without having to check out the git repo or install any software yourself.
