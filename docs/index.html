                <h1>Welcome</h1>
                <p>
                    This is a work in progress
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-flap_display" target="_blank">split-flap display</a>.
                    Each module can flip between 40 unique characters: letters, numbers, and a few symbols. Multiple
                    modules fit perfectly alongside each other to build bigger displays.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The primary design goal was to make something that's possible to fabricate at home in small or
                    single quantities and can be customized and built by an intermediate hobbyist at a reasonable price.
                    This meant using widely available materials and avoiding any tooling with a high upfront cost.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Following that philosophy, the design uses PVC ID badge cards for the flaps (rather than
                    custom die-cut plastic), store-bought vinyl stickers for the letters, and is driven by an
                    ubiquitous and cheap 28BYJ-48 stepper motor. Even the enclosure, spool, and gears, which are all
                    made from laser-cut MDF, can be easily ordered online.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This design is currently at a <i>prototype</i> stage. The source code in the
                    <a href="https://github.com/scottbez1/splitflap" target="_blank">git repo</a>
                    was able to produce a working prototype (with some manual modifications to correct for slight
                    errors/omissions), but I wouldn't necessarily recommend building your own quite yet, until there
                    are fewer bugs, better documentation, and an improved instruction guide.

                    All of the designs are <a href="https://github.com/scottbez1/splitflap/">open source</a>. The 3d
                    model is built using OpenSCAD, the driver electronics board is designed in KiCad, and the driver
                    firmware is written using Arduino.

                    Most of the supporting materials, like the

                    even the interactive 3D rendering seen above are
                    <a href="https://scottbezek.blogspot.com/2016/04/automated-kicad-openscad-rendering.html">generated
                    automatically</a> as the design changes, using Travis CI. This way you can always see the latest
                    designs, even without having to check out the git repo or install any software yourself.
