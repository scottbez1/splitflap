                <h1>Welcome</h1>
                <p>
                    This is a work in progress
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-flap_display" target="_blank">split-flap display</a>.
                    Each module can flip between 40 unique characters: letters, numbers, and a few symbols. Multiple
                    modules fit perfectly alongside each other to build bigger displays.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The primary design goal was to make something that's possible to fabricate at home in small or
                    single quantities and can be customized and built by an intermediate hobbyist at a reasonable price.
                    This meant using widely available materials and avoiding any tooling with a high upfront cost.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Following that philosophy, the design can use store-bought vinyl stickers for the letters, is driven
                    by an ubiquitous and cheap 28BYJ-48 stepper motor, and uses common PVC ID badge cards cut to shape
                    for the flaps (though custom die-cut flaps are also
                    <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/979720975/blank-splitflap-display-flaps" target="_blank">available</a>).
                    Even the enclosure and spool, which are made from laser-cut MDF or acrylic, can be easily ordered online.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This design is currently stable. The source code in the
                    <a href="https://github.com/scottbez1/splitflap" target="_blank">git repo</a>
                    provides 3d designs, electronics schematics and PCBs, and software and firmware that has been tested
                    and used to build displays with up to 108 modules. If you'd like to build your own, see the
                    <a href="https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Ordering-Splitflap-v0.5--ATdB3cgS5GyvwTWq1kpunkD4Ag-iCwwMo0hRkkAlwdutccWf">Ordering Instructions</a>
                    and
                    <a href="https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Splitflap-Kit-v0.5-Assembly-Instructions--ATc8SYKflDsThTsXGZiRPOyTAg-bxXJlke5ROmamcx4OH44r">Assembly Guide</a>.
                    Of course, as this is an open source side-project, you may still come across minor issues or
                    missing documentation; pull requests are appreciated.

                    All of the designs are <a href="https://github.com/scottbez1/splitflap/">open source</a>. The 3d
                    model is built using OpenSCAD, the driver electronics board is designed in KiCad, and the driver
                    firmware is written using Arduino + PlatformIO.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most of the supporting materials, like the schematic, bill of materials, PCB gerbers, and
                    even the interactive 3D rendering seen above are
                    <a href="https://scottbezek.blogspot.com/2016/04/automated-kicad-openscad-rendering.html">generated
                    automatically</a> as the design changes, using Github Actions. This way you can always see the latest
                    designs, even without having to check out the git repo or install any software yourself.
                </p>
